# Privacy Policy

Effective date: 2026-01-19

This Privacy Policy describes how Nancy ("the Service") handles information when you use:

- Nancy Slack bot (the conversational assistant)
- Nancy Brain MCP/HTTP API (the RAG backend at `nancy-brain.malpas.nz`)

If you use Nancy through a third-party client (e.g., Custom GPT, Claude Desktop, VS Code MCP), that client may also collect data under its own policy.

## What We Collect

We collect the minimum data needed to operate the Service:

- **Requests and queries** you send to Nancy (Slack messages, API queries).
- **Identifiers** needed for functionality and abuse prevention (Slack user ID, API key prefix, IP address, timestamps).
- **Optional contact** you provide when requesting an API key.

We do not intentionally collect sensitive personal information.

## How We Use Data

We use collected data to:

- Provide search and retrieval responses
- Operate, secure, and debug the Service
- Monitor reliability and prevent abuse

## Data Sharing

We do not sell your data. We may share data only with service providers required to operate the Service, such as:

- **Slack** (for Slack bot messaging)
- **Cloudflare** (for tunneling/edge protection)
- **Anthropic** (for LLM responses in the Slack bot, when enabled)

## Data Retention

Operational logs and API key records are stored on self-hosted infrastructure and retained as needed for service reliability and security. You can request deletion of your data (see Contact below).

## Security

We use API keys, access controls, and TLS to protect data in transit and restrict access to the Service.

## Your Choices

- You can use the MCP API directly without Slack.
- You may request deletion of your API key and associated records.
- You can stop using the Service at any time.

## Contact

To request data deletion or ask questions, contact: **amber@malpas.nz**

This policy may be updated as the Service evolves. If changes are material, we will update the effective date.
